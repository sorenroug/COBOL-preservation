enables a program to retain a position at the end of execution of the
last ACCEPT statement or to specify the initial position at the start of
any ACCEPT statement. This is a useful facility when programming
menu-type operator prompts. The operator need then only move the

          <para>
The size of an elementary item, where size means the number of
character positions occupied by the elementary item in standard data format,
is determined by the number of allowable symbols that represent character
positions. An integer which is enclosed in parentheses following the symbols
'A', ',', 'X', '9', 'P', 'Z', '*', 'B', '/', '0', '+', '-', or the currency
symbol indicates the number of consecutive occurrences of the symbol. Note
that the following symbols may appear only once in a given PICTURE: 'S',
'V', '.', 'CR', and 'DB'.

The functions of the symbols used to describe an elementary item are

                <para>Each 'B' in the character-string represents a character position into
which the space character will be inserted.

            </varlistentry>
            <varlistentry>
              <term>P -</term>
              <listitem>
                <para>Each 'P' indicates an assumed decimal scaling position and is used to
specify the location of an assumed decimal point when the point is not
within the number that appears in the data item. The scaling position
character 'P' is not counted in the size of the data item. Scaling
position characters are counted in determining the maximum number of
digit positions (18) in numeric edited items or numeric items. The
scaling position character 'P' can appear only to the left or right as
a continuous string of 'P's within a PICTURE description; since the
scaling position character 'P' implies an assumed decimal point (to the
left of 'P's if 'P's are leftmost PICTURE characters and to the right
if 'P's are rightmost PICTURE characters), the assumed decimal point
symbol 'V' is redundant as either the leftmost or rightmost character
within such a PICTURE description. The character 'P' and the insertion
character '.' (period) cannot both occur in the same PICTURE
character-string. If, in any operation involving conversion of data
from one form of internal representation to another, the data item
being converted is described with the PICTURE character 'P', each digit
position described by a 'P' is considered to contain the value zero,
and the size of the data item is considered to include the digit
positions so described.

              <term>S -</term>
              <listitem>
                <para>
The letter 'S' is used in a character-string to indicate the presence,
but neither the representation nor, necessarily, the position of an
operational sign; it must be written as the leftmost character in the
PICTURE. The S is not counted in determining the size (in terms of
standard data format characters) of the elementary item unless the
entry is subject to a SIGN clause which specifies the optional SEPARATE
CHARACTER phrase. (See the SIGN Clause in this Chapter.)

              <term>V -</term>
              <listitem>
                <para>
The 'V' is used in a character-string to indicate the location of the
assumed decimal point and may only appear once in a character-string.
The 'V' does not represent a character position and therefore is not
counted in the size of the elementary item. When the assumed decimal
point is to the right of the rightmost symbol in the string the 'V' is redundant.

leftmost numeric character positions which will be replaced by a space
character when the contents of that character position is zero. Each
'Z' is counted in the size of the item.

     exchanged if the clause DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA is stated in the
     SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph. In this exchange the rules for the period

Special Insertion Editing. The '.' (period) is used as the insertion
character. In addition to being an insertion character it also represents
the decimal point for alignment purposes. The insertion character used for
the actual decimal point is counted in the size of the item. The use of the
assumed decimal point, represented by the symbol 'V' and the actual decimal
point, represented by the insertion character, in the same PICTURE
character-string is disallowed. The result of special insertion editing is
the appearance of the insertion character in the item in the same position
as shown in the character-string.

one currency symbol and only one of the editing sign control symbols can be
used in a given PICTURE character-string. When the symbols 'CR' or 'DB' are
used they represent two character positions in determining the size of the
item and they must represent the rightmost character positions that are
counted in the size of the item. The symbol '+' or '-', when used, must be
either the leftmost or rightmost character position to be counted in the
size of the item. The currency symbol must be the leftmost character.

      The currency symbol and editing sign control symbols '+' or '-' are the
floating insertion characters and as such are mutually exclusive in a given
PICTURE character-string.
</para>
          <para>
      Floating insertion editing is indicated in a PICTURE character-string
by using a string of at least two of the floating insertion characters.
This string of floating insertion characters may contain any of the fixed
insertion symbols or have fixed insertion characters immediately to the
right of this string. These simple insertion characters are part of the
floating string.
</para>
          <para>
      The leftmost character of the floating insertion string represents the
leftmost limit of the floating symbol in the data item. The rightmost
character of the floating string represents the rightmost limit of the
floating symbols in the data item.
</para>
          <para>
      The second floating character from the left represents the leftmost
 limit of the numeric data that can be stored in the data item. Non-zero
 numeric data may replace all the characters at or to the right of this
 limit.
</para>
          <para>
     In a PICTURE character-string, there are only two ways of representing
floating insertion editing. One way is to represent any or all of the
leading numeric character positions on the left of the decimal point by the
insertion character. The other way is to represent all of the numeric
character positions in the PICTURE character-string by the insertion
character.
</para>
          <para>
      If the insertion characters are only to the left of the decimal point
in the PICTURE character-string, the result is that a single floating
insertion character will be placed into the character position immediately
preceding either the decimal point or the first non-zero digit in the data
represented by the insertion symbol string, whichever is farther to the left
in the PICTURE character-string. The character positions preceding the
insertion character are replaced with spaces.
</para>
          <para>
      If all numeric character positions in the PICTURE character-string are
represented by the insertion character, the result depends upon the value of
the data. If the value is zero the entire data item will contain spaces.
If the value is not zero, the result is the same as when the insertion
character is only to the left of the decimal point.
</para>
          <para>
     To avoid truncation, the minimum size of the PICTURE character-string
for the receiving data item must be the number of characters in the sending
data item, plus the number of non-floating insertion characters being edited
into the receiving data item, plus one for the floating insertion character.

          <para>
    The suppression of leading zeros in numeric character positions is
indicated by the use of the alphabetic character 'Z' or the character '*'
(asterisk) as suppression symbols in a PICTURE character-string. These
symbols are mutually exclusive in a given PICTURE character-string. Each
suppression symbol is counted in determining the size of the item. If 'Z'
is used, the replacement character will be the space and if the asterisk is
used, the replacement character will be '*'.
</para>
          <para>
      Zero suppression and replacement is indicated in a PICTURE
character-string by using a string of one or more of the allowable symbols
to represent leading numeric character positions which are to be replaced
when the associated character position in the data contains a zero. Any of
the simple insertion characters embedded in the string of symbols or to the
immediate right of this string are part of the string.
</para>
          <para>
      In a PICTURE character-string, there are only two ways of representing
zero suppression. One way is to represent any or all of the leading numeric
character positions to the left of the decimal point by suppression symbols.
The other.way is to represent all of the numeric character positions in the
PICTURE character-string by suppression symbols.
</para>
          <para>
      If the suppression symbols appear only to the left of the decimal
point, any leading zero in the data which corresponds to a symbol in the
string is replaced by the replacement character. Suppression terminates at
the first non-zero digit in the data represented by the suppression symbol
string or at the decimal point, whichever is encountered first.
</para>
          <para>
     If all numeric character positions in the PICTURE character-string are
represented by suppression symbols and the value of the data is not zero,
the result is the same as if the suppression characters were only to the
left of the decimal point. If the value is zero and the suppression symbol
is 'Z', the entire data item will be spaces. If the value is zero and the
suppression symbol is '*', the data item will be all '*' except for the
actual decimal point.
</para>
          <para>
     The symbols '+', '-', '*' 'Z', and the currency symbol, when used as
floating replacement characters, are mutually exclusive within a given
character-string.

symbol(s) at the top of the column may precede, in a given character-string,
the symbol(s) at the left of the row. Arguments appearing in braces
indicate that the symbols are mutually exclusive. The currency symbol is
indicated by the symbol 'cs'.

         Conditional expressions identify conditions that art, tested to enable
  the object program to select between alternate paths of control depending
 upon the truth value of the condition. Conditional expressions are
 specified in the IF and PERFORM statements. There are two categories of
 conditions associated with conditional expressions: simple conditions and
  relation conditions. Each may be enclosed within any number of paired
 parentheses, in which case its category is not changed.

          <para>
         A relation condition causes a comparison of two operands, each of which
 may be the data item referenced by an identifier, a literal. A relation
  condition has a truth value of 'true' if the relation exists between the
  operands. Comparison of two numeric operands is permitted regardless of the
  formats specified in their respective USAGE clauses. However, for all other
  comparisons the operands must have the same usage. If either of the
  operands is a group item, the nonnumeric comparison rules apply.

</para>
          </note>
          <para>
 The first operand (identifier-1 or literal-1) is called the subject of
  the condition;    the second operand (identifier-2 or literal-2) is called the
  object of the condition. The relation condition must contain at least one
  reference to a variable.
  </para>
          <para>
The relational operator specifies the type of comparison to be made in
  a relation condition. a space must precede and follow each reserved word
  comprising the relational operator. When used, 'NOT' and the next key word
  or relation character are one relational operator that defines the
  comparison to be executed for truth value; e.g., 'NOT EQUAL' is a truth test
  for an 'unequal'.
  </para>
          <para>
Comparison 'NOT GREATER' is a truth test for an 'equal' or 'less'
comparison. The meaning of the relational operators is as shown in Table 3-4.

For operands whose class is numeric a
comparison is made with respect to the algebraic value of the operands. The
length of the literal, in terms of number of digits represented, is not
significant. Zero is considered a unique value regardless of the sign.
Comparison of these operands is permitted regardless of the manner in which
their usage is described. Unsigned numeric operands are considered positive
for purposes of comparison.

For nonnumeric operands, or one numeric
and one nonnumeric operand, a comparison is made with respect to a specified
collating sequence of characters (see The OBJECT-COMPUTER Paragraph in this
Chapter). If one of the operands is specified as numeric, it must be an
integer data item or an integer literal and:

If the nonnumeric operand is an elementary data item or a nonnumeric
literal, the numeric operand is treated as though it were moved to an
elementary alphanumeric data item of the same size as the numeric data
item (in terms of standard data format characters), and the contents of
this alphanumeric data item were then compared to the nonnumeric
operand. (See THE MOVE STATEMENT in this Chapter, and the PICTURE

If the numeric operand is a group item, the numeric operand is treated
as though it were moved to a group item of the same size as the numeric

Operands of equal size - If the operands are of equal size, comparison
effectively proceeds by comparing characters in corresponding character
positions starting from the high order end and continuing until either
a pair of unequal characters is encountered or the low order end of the
operand is reached, whichever comes first. The operands are determined
to be equal if all pairs of characters compare equally through the last
pair, when the low order end is reached.
</para>
                <para>
The first encountered pair of unequal characters is compared to determine
their relative position in the collating sequence. The operand
that contains the character that is positioned higher in the collating
sequence is considered to be the greater operand.

The class condition determines whether the operand is numeric, that is,
consists entirely of the characters '0', '1', '2', '3', ..., '9', with or
without the operational sign, or alphabetic, that is, consists entirely of
the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', ..., 'Z', space. The general format for the

          <para>
The usage of the operand being tested must be described as display.
When used, 'NOT' and the next key word specify one class condition that
defines the class test to be executed for truth value; e.g. 'NOT NUMERIC'
is a truth test for determining that an operand is nonnumeric.
</para>
          <para>
     The NUMERIC test cannot be used with an item whose data description
describes the item as alphabetic or as a group item composed of elementary
items whose data description indicates the presence of operational sign(s).
If the data description of the item being tested does not indicate the
presence of an operational sign, the item being tested is determined to be
numeric only if the contents are numeric and an operational sign is not
present. If the data description of the item does indicate the presence of
an operational sign, the item being tested is determined to be numeric only
if the contents are numeric and a valid operational sign is present. Valid
operational signs for data items described with the SIGN IS SEPARATE clause
are the standard data format characters, '+' and '-'
</para>
          <para>
The ALPHABETIC test cannot be used with an item whose data description
describes the item as numeric. The item being tested is determined to be
alphabetic only if the contents consist of any combination of the alphabetic
characters 'A' thru 'Z' and the space.

      <title>COMMON PHRASES AND GENERAL RULES FOR STATEMENT FORMATS</title>
      <para>
In the statement descriptions that follow, several phrases appear
frequently: the ROUNDED phrase, the SIZE ERROR phrase.

These are described below. A resultant-identifier is that identifier
associated with a result of an arithmetic operation.

        <para>
If, after decimal point alignment, the number of places in the fraction
of the result of an arithmetic operation is greater than the number of
places provided for the fraction of the resultant-identifier, truncation is
relative to the size provided for the resultant-identifier. When rounding
is requested the absolute value of the resultant-identifier is increased by
one whenever the most significant digit of the the excess is greater than or
equal to five.
           </para>
        <para>
When the low-order integer positions in a resultant-identifier are
represented by the character 'P' in the PICTURE for the
resultant-identifier, rounding or truncation occurs relative to the
rightmost integer position for which storage is allocated.

        <para>
If, after decimal point alignment, the absolute value of a result
exceeds the largest value that can be contained in the associated
resultant-identifier a size error condition exists. Division by zero always
causes a size error condition. The size error condition applies only to the
final results, except in MULTIPLY and DIVIDE statements, in which case the
size error condition applies to the intermediate results as well, If the
ROUNDED phrase is specified rounding takes place before checking for size
error. When such a size error condition occurs, the subsequent action
depends on whether or not the SIZE ERROR phrase is specified as follows:
</para>
        <section>
          <title>SIZE ERROR Phrase Not Specified</title>
          <para>
When a size error condition occurs, the value of those
resultant-identifier(s) affected is undefined. Values of
resultant-identifier(s) for which no size error condition occurs are
unaffected by size errors that occur for other resultant-identifier(s)
during execution of this operation.
</para>

        <section>
          <title>SIZE ERROR Phrase Specified</title>
          <para>
When a size error condition occurs, then the values of
resultant-identifier(s) affected by the size errors are not altered.
After completion of the execution of this operation, the imperative statement in
the SIZE ERROR phrase is executed.

The CRT is driven directly by the run time system via a buffer. The
COBOL programmer moves data into and out of this buffer by means of ACCEPT
and DISPLAY statements. Each ACCEPT or DISPLAY action is relative to the
start of the CRT buffer unless POSITION is specified. The syntax is limited
to inputting to or outputting from a single data name. The data name may be
a group item and several such group items may redefine the same area of storage.
   </para>
        <para>
The use of FILLER data items in record descriptions used for input or
output to a CRT device is subject to special rules. On output, any FILLER
item in a record results in suppression of output for the character
positions it defines. On input, any FILLER item suppresses operator keying
into the character positions it defines.

positioned to the CRT location corresponding to the left-most non-FILLER
character position in data-name-1. Alternatively, when CURSOR is
specified in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph, the cursor is positioned at
the position held in the CURSOR data-name in the same format as the screen
position is held in data-name-2. If the cursor data-name has the value SPACE
or ZERO, the effect is as if the CURSOR was not specified; if a valid screen
position is specified that is not within a non-FILLER item, the cursor
is positioned at the nearest non-FILLER character position.
CURSOR data-name holds the last cursor position at the end of execution
of an ACCEPT statement.

Inspection (which includes the comparison cycle, the establishment of
     boundaries for the BEFORE or AFTER phrase, and the mechanism for
     tallying and/or replacing) begins at the leftmost character position of
     the data item referenced by identifier-1, regardless of its class, and
     proceeds from left to right to the rightmost character position as
     described in general rules 4 through 6.

            <para>
For use in the INSPECT statement, the contents of the data item
referenced by identifier-1, identifier-3, identifier-4, identifier-5,
identifier-6 or identifier-7 will be treated as follows:
</para>
            <orderedlist>

                <para>
If any of identifier-1, identifier-3, identifier-4, identifier-5,

INSPECT statement treats the contents of each such identifier as a
character-string.
</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>
If any of identifier-1, identifier-3, identifier-4, identifier-5,
identifier-6 or identifier-7 are described as alphanumeric edited,
numeric edited or unsigned numeric, the data item is inspected as
though it had been redefined as alphanumeric (see general rule 2a)
and the INSPECT statement had been written to reference the
redefined data item.

If any of the identifier-1, identifier-3, identifier-4,

numeric, the data item is inspected as though it had been moved to
an unsigned numeric data item of the same length and then the
rules in general rule 2b had been applied.

            <para>
In general rules 4 through 11 all references to literal-1, literal-2,
literal-3, literal-4, and literal-5 apply equally to the contents of
the data item referenced by identifier-3, identifier-4, identifier-5,
identifier-6, and identifier-7, respectively.

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
During inspection of the contents of the data item referenced by
identifier-1, each properly matched occurrence of literal-1 is tallied
(Formats 1 and 3) and/or each properly matched occurrence of literal-3
is replaced by literal-4 (Formats 2 and 3). Data items to be
referenced by the INSPECT verb should be placed such that they Lie
within the first 10,000 bytes of intermediate code.

              <listitem>
                <para>
The operands of the TALLYING and REPLACING phrases are considered
in the order they are specified in the INSPECT statement from left
to right. The first literal-1, literal-3 is compared to an equal
number of contiguous characters, starting with the leftmost
character position in the data item referenced by identifier-1.
Literal-1, literal-3 and that portion of the contents of the data
item referenced by identifier-1 match if, and only if, they are
equal, character for character.
</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>
If no match occurs in the comparison of the first literal-1,
literal-3, the comparison is repeated with each successive
literal-1, literal-3, if any, until either a match is found or
there ls no next successive literal-1, literal-3. When there is
no next successive literal-1, literal-3, the character position in
the data item referenced by identifier-1 immediately to the right
of the leftmost character position considered in the last
comparison cycle is considered as the leftmost character position,
and the comparison cycle begins again with the first literal-1, literal-3.
</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>
Whenever a match occurs, tallying and/or replacing takes place as
described in general rules 8 through 10. The character position
in the data item referenced by identifier-1 immediately to the
right of the rightmost character position that participated in the
match is now considered to be the leftmost character position of
the data item referenced by identifier-1, and the comparison cycle
starts again with the first literal-1, literal-3.

              <listitem>
                <para>
The comparison operation continues until the rightmost character

If the CHARACTERS phrase is specified, an implied one character
operand participates in the cycle described in paragraphs 5a
through 5d above, except that no comparison to the contents of the
data item referenced by identifier-1 takes place. This implied
character is considered always to match the leftmost character of
the contents of the data item referenced by identifier-1
participating in the current comparison cycle.

The comparison operation defined in general rule 5 is affected by the
   BEFORE and AFTER phrases as follows:

              <listitem>
                <para>

</para>

                <para>
If the BEFORE phrase is specified, the associated literal-1,
literal-3 or the implied operand of the CHARACTERS phrase
participates only in those comparison cycles which involve that
portion of the contents of the data item referenced by
identifier-1 from its leftmost character position up to, but not
including, the first occurrence of literal-2, literal-5 within the
contents of the data item referenced by identifier-1. The
position of this first occurrence is determined before the first
cycle of the comparison operation described in general rule 5 is
begun. If, on any comparison cycle, literal-1, literal-3 or the
implied operand of the CHARACTERS phrase is not eligible to
participate, it is considered not to match the contents of the
data item referenced by identifier-1. If there is no occurrence
of literal-2 literal-5 within the contents of the data item
referenced by identifier-1, its associated literal-1, literal-3,
or the implied operand of the CHARACTERS phrase participates in
the comparison operation as though the BEFORE phrase had not been specified.

              <listitem>
                <para>
If the AFTER phrase is specified, the associated literal-1,
literal-3 or the implied operand of the CHARACTERS phrase may
participate only in those comparison cycles which involve that
portion of the contents of the data item referenced by
identifier-1 from the character position immediately to the right
of the rightmost character position of the first occurrence of
literal-2, literal-5 within the contents of the data item
referenced by identifier-1 and the rightmost character position
of the data item referenced by identifier-1. The position of this
first occurrence is determined before the first cycle of the
comparison operation described in general rule 5 is begun. If, on
any comparison cycle, literal-1, literal-3 or the implied operand
of the CHARACTERS phrase is not eligible to participate, it is
considered not to match the contents of the data item referenced
by identifier-1. If there is no occurrence of literal-2,
literal-5 within the contents of the data item referenced by
identifier-1, its associated literal-1, literal-3, or the implied
operand of the CHARACTERS phrase is never eligible to participate
in the comparison operation.

Any MOVE in which the sending and receiving items are both elementary
items is an elementary move. Every elementary item belongs to one of
the following categories: numeric, alphabetic, alphanumeric, numeric
edited, alphanumeric edited. These categories are described in the
PICTURE clause. Numeric literals belong to the category numeric, and
nonnumeric literals belongs to the category alphanumeric. The
figurative constant ZERO belongs to the category numeric. The
figurative constant SPACE belongs to the category alphabetic. All
other figurative constants belong to the category alphanumeric.
The following rules apply to an elementary move between these categories:

When an alphanumeric edited or alphanumeric item is a receiving
item, alignment and any necessary space filling takes place as
defined under STANDARD ALIGNMENT RULES in this Chapter. If the
size of the sending item is greater than the size of the receiving
item, the excess characters are truncated on the right after the
receiving item is filled. If the sending item is described as
being signed numeric, the operational sign will not be moved; if
the operational sign occupies a separate character position
(see THE SIGN CLAUSE in this Chapter), that character will not be moved
and the size of the sending item will be considered to be one less
than its actual size (in terms of standard data format characters).

When a numeric or numeric edited item is the receiving item,
alignment by decimal point and any necessary zero-filling takes
place as defined under the STANDARD ALIGNMENT RULES in Chapter 2,
except where zeroes are replaced because of editing requirements.
When a signed numeric item is the receiving item, the sign of the
sending item is placed in the receiving item.
(See THE SIGN CLAUSE in this Chapter). Conversion of the representation of
the sign takes place as necessary. If the sending item is
unsigned, a positive sign is generated for the receiving item.

                <para>
When an unsigned numeric item is the receiving item, the absolute
value of the sending item is moved and no operational sign is

occurs only once for each execution of a PERFORM statement. For those
cases where a transfer of control to the named procedure does take
place, an implicit transfer of control to the next executable statement
following the PERFORM statement is established as follows:

There is no necessary relationship between procedure-name-1     and
procedure-name-2 except that a consecutive sequence of operations is to
be executed beginning at the procedure named procedure-name-1 and
ending with the execution of the procedure named procedure-name-2. In
particular, GO TO and PERFORM statements may occur between
procedure-name-1 and the end of procedure-name-2. If there are two or
more logical paths to the return point, then procedure-name-2 may be
the name of a paragraph consisting of the EXIT statement, to which all
of these paths must lead.

If control passes to these procedures other than via a PERFORM

executable statement in the main program as if they were just part of

The PERFORM statements operate as follows with rule 3 above applying to
all formats:
</para>
            <orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>
Format 1 is the basic PERFORM statement. A procedure referenced
by this type of PERFORM statement is executed once and then
control passes to the next executable statement following the
PERFORM statement.
</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>
Format 2 is the PERFORM TIMES. The procedures are performed the
number of times specified by integer-1 or by the initial value of
the data item referenced by identifier-1 for that execution. If,
at the time of execution of a PERFORM statement, the value of the
data item referenced by identifier-1 is equal to zero or is
negative, control passes to the next executable statement
following the PERFORM statement. Following the execution of the
procedures the specified number of times, control is transferred
to the next executable statement following the PERFORM statement.
During execution of the PERFORM statement, references to
identifier-1 cannot alter the number of times the procedures are to be
executed from that which was indicated by the initial value of identifier-1.
</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>
         Format 3 is the PERFORM...UNTIL. The specified procedures are
          performed until the condition specified by the UNTIL phrase is
           true. When the condition is true, control is transferred to the
          next executable statement after the PERFORM statement. If the
            condition is true when the PERFORM statement is entered, no
            transfer to procedure-name-1 takes place, and control is passed to
            the next executable statement following the PERFORM statement.
    </para>
              </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
If a sequence of statements referred to by a PERFORM statement includes
another PERFORM statement, the sequence of procedures associated with
the included PERFORM must itself either be totally included in, or
totally excluded from, the logical sequence referred to by the first
PERFORM. Thus, an active PERFORM statement, whose execution point
begins within the range of another active PERFORM statement, must not
allow control to pass to the exit of the other active PERFORM
statement; furthermore, two or more such active PERFORM statements may
not have a common exit. See Figure 3-1.
