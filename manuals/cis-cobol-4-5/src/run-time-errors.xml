  <title>RUN-TIME ERRORS</title>
  <para>
Run-time error messages are preceded by the name and segment number of
the currently executing intermediate code file.
</para>
  <para>
There are two types of runtime errors:   Recoverable and Fatal.
</para>
  <para>
(a)  Recoverable errors
</para>
  <para>
If the programmer has specified the STATUS clause in the FILE-CONTROL
paragraph of a program error handling is the programmer's responsibility.
This will generally only apply to errors that are not considered fatal
by the operating system.
</para>
  <para>
(b)  Fatal errors
</para>
  <para>
All errors except those above are fatal. They may come from the operating
system or from the run-time system. Fatal errors cause a message to be
output to the console which includes a 3-digit error code and reference to
the COBOL statement subsequent to that in which the error occurred. These
fall into two classes:
</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>(i)  Exceptions</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
These cover arithmetic overflow, subscript out of range, too many levels of perform nesting.
</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>(ii) I-O errors</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
These exclude those for which STATUS is not selected as above.
