The FORMS-2 package is an extension to the CIS or L/II COBOL software development
system which enables interactive creation and editing of data entry screens
for applications programs at a CRT. The package provides four powerful
facilities to aid the design and development of interactive applications
written in CIS or L/II COBOL:
</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
Translation of user screen layouts into COBOL record descriptions
for inclusion in COBOL applications programs.

    <title>OUTPUTS</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>Outputs</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
The user can choose any valid combination of the above facilities and
dependent on the options selected FORMS-2 will automatically produce the
following four types of disk output file:-
</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
A source file of CIS or L/II COBOL Data Description Statements defining
the user designed screens (forms). These statements can
subsequently be included in a CIS or L/II COBOL application program using
the COPY verb. The file is generated as filename.DDS.
</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
A source file of a Check-Out program incorporating the Data
Description Statements defining the user's screens. After
compilation the user is able to verify the data entry form prior
to building the actual application. The file is generated as
filename.CHK.
</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
Screen Image files of exact copies of the user defined forms. The
files are generated as filename.Snn (nn is 00 to 99).
</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
A file of the source of an Index program based on the user screen.
After compilation the generated program can be used for the
storage, retrieval, updating and deletion of data entered via the
users form. The file is generated as filename.GEN.
</para>
      </listitem>

    <title>PHASES</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>Phases</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
FORMS-2 processing is divided between a number of logically distinct units
but two main phases can be identified - Initialisation Phase and Work Phase:
</para>
    <section>
      <title>Initialisation Phase</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>Initialisation Phase</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
The Initialisation phase is passed through once only and establishes the
characteristics of this particular run of the program. It is a series of
screens containing self-explanatory prompts to which the user replies as
necessary.
</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Work Phase</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>Work Phase</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
At least two Work Phases are passed through for each data entry screen
required by the application.
</para>
      <para>
The FORMS-2 screen is analogous to a paper form in which the printed fixed
text is used as a guide to entering the variable data in the spaces
provided. To the human eye it is obvious where the variable data entry
areas occur on a form but the computer needs to have these areas defined
explicitly. There are, therefore, two types of Work Phase: one in which
fixed text is specified and one in which variable data fields are specified.

    <title>OPERATOR INTERFACE</title>

      <primary>Operator Interface</primary>

    <para>
FORMS-2 is written in COBOL and uses the ACCEPT and DISPLAY extended CIS and L/II COBOL features.
These two verbs are described in the <citetitle pubwork="book">CIS or L/II COBOL Language Reference Manual</citetitle>, as are the cursor control features.

following table. The actual key may vary from that shown dependent on the
particular CRT being used.

      <title>CRT CONFIGURATION</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>CRT Configuration</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
FORMS-2 is issued for use with a standard CRT dependent on your operating
system (O/S). It can be configured for other CRTs using the CONFIG program
supplied.
</para>
      <para>
If your system is already configured for your specific CRT (i.e. BASF
implementation), CONFIG is not supplied. Skip straight to the next heading
FORMS-2 VALIDATION on the next page.
</para>
      <para>
For non-standard systems, the notes given in Appendix D describe the most
straightforward case. If you are using variants of the O/S or any
non-standard CRTs you should refer to the
<citetitle pubwork="book">CIS or L/II COBOL Operating Guide</citetitle> for a
more detailed description of CONFIG.
</para>
      <para>
Boot up as before with the Issue Disk in the second drive. Then load and
run the CONFIG program by setting the O/S to access the second drive and
then typing the CONFIG load command for your O/S.
</para>
      <para>
The configurator will sign on and output questions as follows:

prompt sign.
</para>
<para>
Enter: FORMS2.COM&lt;&lt;

<para>
and wait while the file is accessed. When it is ready, a prompt
is displayed to ask if the CRT is to be tailored.
</para>
<para>
Enter: Y
</para>
<para>
A range of pre-defined CRT's is then offered. If the CRT is one
of those shown, select the CRT and answer the final few questions
described below. If the CRT is not one of those shown then type Z
and answer the questions from CONFIG concerning the CRT
characteristics.
</para>
<para>
A final few questions are then asked associated with options
designed to accommodate users who need to access their CRT and
keyboard directly through the I-O ports without using the standard’
O/S access methods.
</para>
<para>
Unless any variants of the O/S are being used, the reply N (No) is
made to the question relating to I-O ports, and to the byte mask
facility. Likewise the tab defaults can be accepted by a N (No)
reply.

those offered, make the appropriate selection, otherwise you will
