  <title>OPERATING FORMS-2 WITH YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM</title>
  <para>
This Appendix describes the commands that you will need to configure, load and
run FORMS-2 under the BASF 7100 BOS Operating System (O/S) that you are using.
</para>
  <para>
Other commands and directives are described in the <citetitle pubwork="book">CIS COBOL Operating Guide</citetitle> for your O/S. 
</para>
  <para>
The symbol &lt;&lt; indicates that the RETURN key or equivalent should be pressed once.
</para>
  <para>
To further clarify the sequences, the O/S prompts, are included before the
commands in this Appendix.
</para>
  <para>
It is assumed that the O/S is loaded, and that the issued files have been copied
to the O/S system disk which is loaded in drive 0. In order to be able to
compile your FORMS-2 generated programs it is essential that the CIS COBOL
system disk is loaded in drive 1.
</para>
  <section>
    <title>FORMS-2 LOADING</title>
    <para>To load FORMS-2 as issued, the command is:</para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN FORMS2:0&lt;&lt;
</screen>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>FORMS 2 CHECKOUT PROGRAM COMPILATION.</title>
    <para>To compile the Check-Out program that enables you to check your fixed text and
    variable data fields, the general command is:
    </para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN COBOL:1 basename.CHK COPYLIST&lt;&lt;
</screen>
    <para>
  In the sample runs in Chapters 2, 7 and 9, basename is, of course, DEMO1 and
DEMO2 respectively.
</para>
    <para>To be able to load the Check-Out program directly in subsequent use the
following general command is entered:
    </para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN RTS:1 = basename.INT&lt;&lt;
</screen>
    <para>Thereafter the general command following can be used to load the Check-Out
program:
    </para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN basename:n&lt;&lt;
</screen>
    <para>  
  where n is the drive number
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>FORMS-2 INDEX PROGRAM COMPILATION</title>
    <para>To enable the Index program that processes an indexed sequential data file from
your FORMS-2 screens to be compiled the following general command is entered:
</para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN COBOL: 1 basename.GEN COPYLIST&lt;&lt;
</screen>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>FORMS-2 INDEX PROGRAM RUNNING</title>
    <para>The Index program that processes an Indexed sequential data file from your
FORMS-2 screens can be loaded immediately after compilation by the general
command:
</para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN RTS:1 basename.INT&lt;&lt;
</screen>
    <para>
In the sample run in Chapter 9 basename is, of course, DEMO2.
</para>
    <para>In the BOS RUN command the user can specify the size of files to be allocated by
the Index program, by inserting the parameter [nnn] after basename.INT as follows:
</para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN RTS:1 basename.INT:n [nnn]&lt;&lt;
</screen>
    <para>
  where:
</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>n is the drive number</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>nnn is the maximum number of records to be occupied by the files. The
default allocated is 2/3 of the disk (100 sectors)
</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>To be able to load the Index program directly in subsequent use the following
general command is entered:
</para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN RTS:1 = basename.INT&lt;&lt;
</screen>
    <para>Thereafter the general command following can be used to load the Index program:
</para>
    <screen>
  EDIT&#x2308; RUN basename:n&lt;&lt;
</screen>
    <para>
  where n is the drive number.
</para>
