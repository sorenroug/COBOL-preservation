Forms2gn.com had the following modifactions made:

Take that FORMS2.COM from the Z80 coprocessor and do...

1856: CD 80 2B -> 00 00 00
2A55: CD F4 FF -> 00 00 00
2A65: CD F4 FF -> 00 00 00
2AC4: 00 -> 20

I have not bothered to search exactly what these calls do,
the code itself just tells anyone which value it expects at 2AC4.

Probably just a few Z80 coprocessor specific calls
"Read/Write I/O memory" and "Cursor Controls".
