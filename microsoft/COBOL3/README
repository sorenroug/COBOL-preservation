ADIS is the video run-time system.  You run a program called ADISCF (ADIS
ConFiguration), which modifies a file called ADISCTRL, that contains the
specifications for your video hardware interface.  When you run a program
with a Screen Section, ADIS is loaded and used to interface with the video.

ADIS.EXE is the screen accept display module.  If you link it
into existence, the Cobol code will execute it as soon as the
code execute screen i/o.  If it does not find it, you will get a
run time error. To create ADIS.exe, link ADIS.OBJ, ADITINIT.OBJ
and ADISKEY.OBJ.  Alternatively, you can link the above with
the .OBJ created by the compiler, and then you do not need
ADIS.EXE.  Note that the isam module behaves the same.  I link as
follows, where the compiled program was RIR.CBL and the compiler
produced RIR..OBJ. LINK @RIR.LNK RIR.LNK contains the following:
\LIBRARY\RIR\RIRO\RIR+\COBOL\ADIS+\COBOL\ADISINIT+\COBOL\ADISKEY+\COBOL\IXSI
\LIBRARY\RIR\RIRO\RIR.LIB

The IXSIO is the indexed sequential I/O module.
