The KEYBCF Utility                                   Doc V1.2    18 Aug 88
==================

KEYBCF allows you to change the functions assigned to the keys on your keyboard.
You can change the action performed by keys during execution of an Accept
statement, the keys used by ANIMATOR and the function keys used by your own
programs.

The default set of keys used by COBOL is built into the system. KEYBCF creates
a file called COBKEYMP which contains the set of keys you require. At run time,
the COBOL system, or any COBOL program using the ACCEPT/DISPLAY module ADIS,
looks for the presence of COBKEYMP in the current directory . If the file is not
found then the environment variable COBDIR is examined and the directory
corresponding to its value is searched for the existence of the COBKEYMP file.
If the file is found the set of keys defined in it are used. If not, the default
set of keys are used.

The Key Lists
-------------
Note : The term 'Function Key' used in this document refers to any of the
       programmable keys on the keyboard.

The following lists of keys can be reviewed and altered by KEYBCF

- ADIS function key list

This list defines the keys which will carry out specified functions when you are
executing an ACCEPT statement in a COBOL program.

- ANIMATOR function key list

This list is used by ANIMATOR and some other system programs.

- User function key list

The user function key list defines the keys that are normally returned to your
program when a function key is pressed.

- Compatibility function key list

This list defines an alternative user key list that can be used if you wish to
set up keys to be compatible with a different dialect of COBOL. If the
values returned by such keys differ from the user key list used in this COBOL
system, you are advised to alter the compatibility function key list rather than
the user function key list. By default, the compatibility function key list is
configured for compatibility with Ryan McFarland COBOL Version 2.0 on UNIX.

One of the Accept/Display options in the ADISCF program allows you to choose
between using the User or Compatibility key lists.


Note that during an ACCEPT operation, the user (or compatability) function key
table is searched prior to the ADIS function key table. Therefore, if a key is
defined in both lists, it will be found first in the user key list and acted on
accordingly.

By default, the user function keys are initially disabled. In order to use these
function keys during the execution of a program, you must first enable them by
CALLing the X"AF" sub-program (see the sub-programs section in the COBOL
Operating Guide) or by altering the configuration using ADISCF (see the COBOL
Operating Guide for details about ADISCF).

The CRT STATUS clause allows you to ascertain which function key was used to
terminate an ACCEPT operation. Full details on the use of this clause can be
found in the COBOL Language Reference Manual.


Invoking KEYBCF
---------------
To set up your own COBKEYMP file using KEYBCF, type the command line:

      KEYBCF  <cr>

KEYBCF searches for a file called COBKEYMP in the current directory. If it does
not exist then the environment variable COBDIR is examined and the directory
corresponding to its value is searched for the existence of the COBKEYMP file.
If the file already exists you are asked if you want to edit it. Answer 'Y' if
you want to edit the file or 'N' if you want to create a new file based on the
default set of keys.


Using KEYBCF
------------
KEYBCF is menu driven.  Once it is invoked, it displays its initial menu :-


    -----------------------------------------------------------------

        ADIS Keyboard Configuration Program V1.3

        The following options are available:

           1.  Review existing function key definitions.
           2.  Alter function key definitions.
           3.  Save function key definitions.
           4.  Exit.

        Enter number of option required.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------

To select the option of your choice, press its associated number. The sub-menu
for that function is then displayed.


1. Review Existing Function Key Definitions

Entering 1 on the main KEYBCF menu displays a sub-menu in which you are prompted
to choose which set of function keys you wish to review. To select the option of
your choice, press its associated number. Once you have entered the number of
the list you want to review, the hexadecimal values of all the currently defined
function keys in that list are displayed. To cycle from one screen to the next
press any key. Once the end of the list is reached press any key to return to
the review sub-menu.

Press 5 to return to the main KEYBCF menu.


2. Alter Function Key Definitions

Entering 2 on the main KEYBCF menu displays a sub-menu in which you are prompted
to choose the set of function keys you wish to alter. As with the review
sub-menu you can select the ADIS, ANIMATOR, user or compatibility key lists.
When you have made your selection, a screen in the following format is
displayed:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------

    ADIS/ANIMATOR/User/Compatibility Function Key List

    Function                                 nn

    Enter required key sequence:






    I=Inserts, D=Delete, X=Hexadecimal Input, Space=Skip, Q=Quit

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

Note that, nn is the hexadecimal value of the key assigned to that function.

Each function in the function key list you selected is displayed individually,
as illustrated above. To cycle from one function to the next, without altering
the key defined for each function, press the space key. If you wish to replace
any keys currently defined in one of the lists press the new key which will
perform that function. Once you have entered the new key the program
automatically cycles to the next function after a slight pause.

If you want to retain a currently defined function key, but wish to add another
key to perform the same function, press I before you enter the required key. The
word 'Insert' will be displayed at the bottom right of the screen. If you want
to delete a defined function key from a list press D; KEYBCF automatically
cycles to the next function.

To enter a new function key either press the actual key you want to perform a
certain function, or enter the hexadecimal sequence for the key. If you want to
enter the hexadecimal sequence press X - you will note the word 'Hex' appears at
the bottom right of your screen indicating that the program is expecting
hexadecimal input. If you enter an invalid hexadecimal sequence you will receive
an error when you attempt to cycle to the next function and you will be prompted
to enter a valid sequence. This function allows you to define keys which may not
actually appear on the keyboard you are using, but will be available on the one
on which your program will run.

You can return to the Alter sub-menu at any time by pressing Q.

Entering 5 on this sub-menu returns you to the main KEYBCF menu.


3. Save Function Key Definitions

If you wish to save any alterations you have made to any of the function lists
press 3 on the main KEYBCF menu.  This saves the amended function lists to a
file called COBKEYMP.


4. Exiting from KEYBCF

Press 4 on the main KEYBCF menu to return to the operating system.



Example.
---------

An example follows of how to use KEYBCF to alter the ANIMATOR key list .
It describes the steps required to Insert , Delete and Change key definitions.
The example assumes that the file COBKEYMP has not been previously created
and hence the values shown by KEYBCF are the defaults it sets up.

Enter KEYBCF by typing KEYBCF <cr>

Press 2 on the KEYBCF main menu to display the sub-menu for altering key lists.

Press 2 again to alter the ANIMATOR key list.

The screen for ANIMATOR function key 1 appears. Press D to delete the definition
of this key.

The screen for function key 2 now shows. Press the SPACE BAR to skip over the
key definition and continue to do so until the screen for Cursor Up appears.
Press Ctrl and U .The hexadecimal value corresponding to Ctrl-U appears as
the definition of Cursor Up . This has now replaced the old value of Cursor Up.

The screen for Cursor Down should now appear . Press I to insert a definition
and then press Ctrl and D. The hexadecimal value for Ctrl-D appears.
The next screen is then displayed showing the value for Cursor Down which
already exists ie there are now two definitions available for Cursor Down.

Press Q to quit and return to the sub-menu.

Press 5 to return to the main menu.

Press 3 to save the new function key definitions . This creates the COBKEYMP
file.

You may now wish to press 1 to enter the sub-menu to review the keys followed
by 2 to review the ANIMATOR key list definitions. This will show the values of
all keys in the ANIMATOR key list and will contain the new values entered.
If the keys were reviewed press 5 to return to the main menu.

Press 4 to Exit.


After exiting from KEYBCF:

In order to demonstrate the changes made it is necessary to use the ANIMATOR.
If necessary, consult the COBOL Operating Guide for details of how to use
the ANIMATOR.

After entering the ANIMATOR the ANIMATOR screen will appear.

Press F1=Help .    Nothing should happen since the definition of ANIMATOR
                   function key 1 was deleted by KEYBCF.

Press Cursor-Up.   Nothing should happen. Now press Ctrl-U. This now acts as
                   Cursor-Up since the definition of Cursor Up was changed.
                   This shows that the definition of Cursor-Up has been changed
                   by KEYBCF.

Press Cursor-Down. This still moves the cursor down one line.
Press Ctrl-D.      This also moves the cursor down one line since Ctrl-D was
                   inserted as a new definition , and the old definition was
                   retained.


The defaults may be recovered by either using KEYBCF and returning the key
definitions to their old values , or by simply deleting the COBKEYMP file.
